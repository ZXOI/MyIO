# MyIO
## Your stupid school OJ make your `cin`/`cout` TLE? This is for you!
## Description
Just simply replacing `cin`/`cout` with `scanf`/`printf`.  
Supports types: `int`,`long long`,`char`,`string`.  
As I don't know how to transfer custom types,using `cin`/`cout` as `bool` type, such as `while(cin>>n)` is not supported.  
To develop it more easily, I added `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std` on the top. You can ignore it.
## Usage
Copy myio.cpp(without the first 2 lines) into the top of your code, **after `using namespace std`**.
