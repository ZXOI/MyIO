# MyIO
### Your stupid school OJ make your `cin`/`cout` TLE? This is for you!
## Description
Just simply replacing `cin`/`cout` with `scanf`/`printf`.  
As I don't know how to transfer custom types,using `cin`/`cout` as `bool` type, such as `while(cin>>n)` is not supported.  
## Usage
Copy myio.cpp into the top of your code, **after `using namespace std`**.
